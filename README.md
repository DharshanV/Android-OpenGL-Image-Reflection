# Android-OpenGL-Image-Reflection
An Android OpenGL project that focuses on cube map reflection. Reflections either through sample cube map or user-created cube map with the camera. Upon research, I figured it would be cumbersome to implement 360 picture taker, so I simplified it by letting the user take 6 pictures that map to faces on the cube map.
